# Quantum-Resistant Bitcoin Wallet

## Overview
A cutting-edge wallet system built on Stacks blockchain that implements post-quantum cryptography algorithms to secure Bitcoin transactions against potential quantum computing threats. This project aims to provide a secure transition path for existing Bitcoin addresses to quantum-resistant alternatives.

## Features
- Post-quantum cryptographic security using advanced algorithms
- Automated migration system for existing Bitcoin addresses
- Secure wallet management system
- Real-time balance tracking
- Quantum-resistant signature verification
- Compatible with Stacks blockchain and Bitcoin

## Technical Architecture
### Core Components
1. **Wallet Management System**
   - Quantum key pair generation
   - Address management
   - Balance tracking
   - Transaction history

2. **Quantum Cryptography Layer**
   - Post-quantum signature schemes
   - Key encapsulation mechanisms
   - Hash-based signatures

3. **Migration Module**
   - Automated address migration
   - Legacy address support
   - Transition security protocols

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Stacks blockchain node
- Clarity CLI
- Node.js v14 or higher
- Bitcoin Core (optional for full node support)

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantum-resistant-wallet

# Install dependencies
clarinet install

# Run tests
clarinet test

# Deploy contract
clarinet deploy
```

## Usage

### Initialize Wallet
```clarity
(contract-call? .quantum-wallet initialize-wallet 
    "bc1..." 
    0x[quantum-public-key])
```

### Update Quantum Key
```clarity
(contract-call? .quantum-wallet update-quantum-key
    0x[new-quantum-key])
```

### Check Balance
```clarity
(contract-call? .quantum-wallet get-balance tx-sender)
```

## Security Considerations
- All quantum keys should be securely generated and stored
- Regular key rotation is recommended
- Keep backup of both classical and quantum keys
- Monitor for quantum computing advancements

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Current)
- ✅ Basic wallet implementation
- ✅ Quantum key management
- ✅ Basic security features

### Phase 2 (Upcoming)
- SPHINCS+ implementation
